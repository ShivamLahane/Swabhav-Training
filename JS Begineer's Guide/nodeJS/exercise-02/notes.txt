Global namespace problem solution :
    - to make a function and put everything inside a function like methods and all the variables
    - i.e. IIFE

Imediately invoked function expression syntax :

    1) First of all, define a function expression.
           var myIIFE = function () 
                        {
                            //write your js code here
                        };

    2) Now, wrap it with parenthesis.   
    (function () { write your js code here })();

Advantages of IIFE:

- Do not create unnecessary global variables and functions
- Functions and variables defined in IIFE do not conflict with other functions & variables even if they have same name.
- Organize JavaScript code.
- Make JavaScript code maintainable.

Local Storage limitations :

-As easy as it is to use localStorage, it is also easy to misuse it. The following are limitations, and also ways to NOT use localStorage:
- Do not store sensitive user information in localStorage
- It is not a substitute for a server based database as information is only stored on the browser
- localStorage is limited to 5MB across all major browsers
- localStorage is quite insecure as it has no form of data protection and can be accessed by any code on your web page
- localStorage is synchronous, meaning each operation called would only execute one after the other

Session storage :

- The sessionStorage object is used much less often than localStorage.
- Properties and methods are the same, but itâ€™s much more limited:
- The sessionStorage exists only within the current browser tab.
- Another tab with the same page will have a different storage.
- But it is shared between iframes in the same tab (assuming they come from the same origin).
- 

The data survives page refresh, but not closing/opening the tab.
